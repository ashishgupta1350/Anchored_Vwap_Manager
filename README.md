Project Goals:

1) Stop Loss Trailing
2) Live Anchored VWAP Chart (Logic to be determined)
3) Logic to not sell when crossing from above to below anchored vwap line
4) placing anchors on the "low" ? Idk
5) Buying only when down trend as confirmed by future's anchored vwap on same timeframe as the option ? 
6) Telegram signals for buy and sell
7) Telegram send chart of when buy / sell signal is generated


For charting, i can draw a chart and save as png in orders file. So , it displays open positions as blips and trades took in the past as blips too.
