The data is at a 5-minute interval over a specified date range.\\n\\n- It calculates the 50-period and 200-period simple moving averages (SMA) of the Close prices using TA-Lib\\u0027s SMA function. \\n\\n- It detects the presence of a head and shoulders pattern in the price data using TA-Lib\\u0027s CDLHEADANDSHOULDERS function, which analyzes the Open, High, Low, Close values.\\n\\n- It plots the price data, SMAs and detected head and shoulders pattern on a chart using matplotlib. \\n\\n- The chart shows the close price in blue, 50-SMA in orange, 200-SMA in green. Head and shoulders signals are plotted in red.\\n\\n- Labels, titles, legends are added to the chart for readability. Gridlines and rotated x-axis labels are used to improve the visualization.\\n\\nSo in summary, it performs technical analysis of stock price data to detect head and shoulders patterns using TA-Lib and visualizes the results on a chart.\&quot;,\&quot;/main.py\&quot;:\&quot;This Python file contains code for backtesting a trading strategy based on anchored volume-weighted average price (VWAP).\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- fetch_data(): Reads in the OHLCV data from a CSV file and formats it.\\n\\n- num_days_in_dataframe(): Calculates the number of days in the date range of a DataFrame. \\n\\n- get_anchors_from_dataframe(): Finds the highest high value and its index in the DataFrame, which will act as anchors.\\n\\n- convert_index_to_datetime(): Converts the DataFrame index to datetime objects.\\n\\n- get_n_days_data_from_dataframe(): Extracts a specified number of days of data from the DataFrame. \\n\\n- get_multiple_anchors_from_dataframe(): Finds multiple anchor points based on the number of days in the data.\\n\\n- backtest_actual(): Performs the backtest logic - calculates anchored VWAP, checks if close is within range, and simulates buy/sell decisions. \\n\\n- backtest(): Main backtesting function that splits data, runs backtest_actual() and plots results.\\n\\n- strategy_main(): Driver function that can run backtest() or test functions.\\n\\nSo in summary, it loads and prepares OHLCV data, calculates anchored VWAP values, backtests a strategy based on close being within the anchored VWAP range, and plots the results.\&quot;,\&quot;/backtesting_icici.py\&quot;:\&quot;This Python file contains code for backtesting an anchored VWAP trading strategy on options data.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- fetch_data(): Reads in the options data from a CSV file and formats it as a Pandas DataFrame.\\n\\n- num_days_in_dataframe(): Calculates the number of days in the data. \\n\\n- get_anchors_from_dataframe(): Finds the highest high value in the data and its index, which will be used as anchors. \\n\\n- get_multiple_anchors_from_dataframe(): Calculates multiple anchors based on the number of days in the data.\\n\\n- convert_index_to_datetime(): Converts the DataFrame index to datetime objects.\\n\\n- backtest_actual(): Performs the backtest on a train-test split of the data, calculating signals and positions.\\n\\n- advanced_backtesting_icici(): Performs a more advanced backtest that loops through each day, strike and candle, calculating anchored VWAP in real-time. \\n\\n- strategy_main(): Calls the advanced backtesting function with parameters like dates, intervals etc. \\n\\nSo in summary, it loads options data, calculates anchored VWAP signals on a rolling basis, and backtests a trading strategy based on those signals over multiple time periods to evaluate performance.\&quot;,\&quot;/backtest_config.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains various utility functions for backtesting options trading strategies.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- autologin() - Logs into the ICICI Direct API using Selenium to generate a session token.\\n\\n- get_historical_data_for_stock_fut_index() - Gets historical OHLC data for stocks/indices from the ICICI API. Handles pagination if data spans multiple requests. \\n\\n- get_historical_data_for_option() - Gets historical OHLC data for a specific option contract from ICICI API.\\n\\n- plot_data(), plot_ohlc_v2() - Plot candlestick charts of options data.\\n\\n- get_expiry_date_for_candle() - Calculates the expiry date for a given expiry type (weekly/monthly), underlying and date.\\n\\n- get_strikes_away(), get_strikes_away_v2() - Get strike prices around a given strike price.\\n\\n- create_position_files_with_anchors() - Creates position files to store simulated trades for each anchor/strategy.\\n\\n- get_ltp_icici(), get_options_ltp_icici() - Get live LTP from ICICI API for index/option.\\n\\n- print_signal() - Prints simulated trade signals in a standard format.\\n\\nSo in summary, it contains utilities for fetching historical and live market data, calculating expiry dates, plotting charts, and managing simulated backtest trades and signals. This would allow backtesting and analyzing options trading strategies using real market data from ICICI.\&quot;,\&quot;/README.md\&quot;:\&quot;This README.md file describes the goals and functionality of a trading bot project.\\n\\nKey points:\\n\\n- It lists 7 project goals for the trading bot, related to stop loss trailing, live anchored VWAP charting, logic for not selling when crossing the anchored VWAP line, placing anchors on lows, buying only in downtrends, sending Telegram signals for buys/sells, and sending charts of buy/sell signals.\\n\\n- It provides some details on how charting could be implemented - by drawing charts and saving as PNG files in the orders folder, to display open positions and past trades as markers on the chart. \\n\\n- The file serves as documentation for the project, outlining the intended functionality and features of the trading bot. It provides an overview of what the bot is designed to do.\\n\\n- Maintaining a README helps other developers understand what the project is about and how it works at a high level if they need to work on or modify the code in the future.\\n\\nSo in summary, the key functions of this README.md file are to:\\n\\n1) Document the goals and scope of the trading bot project\\n2) Provide high-level details on how certain features will be implemented  \\n3) Serve as introductory documentation for other developers\&quot;,\&quot;/Icici_Autologger.py\&quot;:\&quot;This Python file automates the login process for an ICICI Direct trading account using the Breeze API.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- autologin(): The main function that orchestrates the login flow.\\n\\n- Checks for an existing token file. If present, tries to login using Breeze API.\\n\\n- Launches Chrome browser and navigates to ICICI Direct login page. \\n\\n- Finds and fills username, password fields and clicks login button.\\n\\n- Finds and fills OTP pin field with token from TOTP library. \\n\\n- Clicks submit and waits for login.\\n\\n- Extracts temporary session token from URL. \\n\\n- Saves token to a file.\\n\\n- Generates Breeze session using the token. \\n\\n- Calls Breeze API to get account funds as a test.\\n\\n- Closes the browser.\\n\\nSo in summary, it automates the full login process by controlling the browser, extracting the session token, and using the Breeze API for authenticated requests. The session token is stored for future logins without entering credentials again.\&quot;,\&quot;/main_icici_direct.py\&quot;:\&quot;This Python file contains code for backtesting an anchored VWAP trading strategy on options data from ICICI Direct.\\n\\nSome key functions:\\n\\n- autologin(): Logs into ICICI Direct API using Selenium and saves session token.\\n\\n- get_historical_data_for_option(): Gets OHLCV data for a given option from ICICI Direct API. \\n\\n- get_options_ltp_icici(): Gets latest price (LTP) for an option from ICICI Direct API.\\n\\n- get_multiple_anchors_from_dataframe(): Finds multiple anchor points in the options data based on number of days.\\n\\n- create_position_files_with_anchors(): Creates files to track positions for each strike/anchor combination.\\n\\n- Main backtesting loop:\\n\\n  - Gets strikes around current underlying price\\n\\n  - Loops through strikes\\n\\n  - Loops through anchors for each strike\\n\\n  - Calculates anchored VWAP\\n\\n  - Checks for buy/sell signals based on LTP vs anchored VWAP\\n\\n  - Manages existing positions by checking profit/loss thresholds\\n\\n- Additional supporting functions for calculating expiry dates, nearest strikes, formatting dates etc. \\n\\nSo in summary, it automates the process of backtesting an anchored VWAP strategy on ICICI Direct options data by finding signals, managing positions and calculating profits.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
